# Chrome extension for PassHub


The extension is a helper tool for the [PassHub.net](https://passhub.net) web password manager. 

PassHub employs [WWPass](https://www.wwpass.com/) technology for strong multi-factor authentication (MFA) and client-side encryption. PassHub features credentials, notes, and file storage combined with fine-grained sharing capabilities. PassHub interface resembles well-known KeePass user experience. In addition, PassHub is fully export/import compatible with KeePass, the password manager of choice for IT professionals. 

The **PassHub Chrome extension** is a non-intrusive tool to fill username/password fields in login forms.

By no means the extension is a silver bullet, rather it is a semi-manual tool to select the appropriate account and fill usernames and passwords into login forms on web sites.
